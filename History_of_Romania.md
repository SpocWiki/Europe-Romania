> The Romanian state was formed in 1859 
> through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. 
> The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, 
> gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. 
> 
> During World War I, after declaring its neutrality in 1914, 
> Romania fought together with the Allied Powers from 1916. 
> In the aftermath of the war, Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transylvania, 
> and parts of Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș became part of the Kingdom of Romania. 
> 
> In June–August 1940, 
> as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award, 
> Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union 
> and Northern Transylvania to Hungary. 
> In November 1940, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and, consequently, 
> in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side, 
> fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, 
> when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania.
>
> Following the war and occupation by the Red Army, 
> Romania became a socialist republic and a member of the Warsaw Pact. 
> 
> After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition towards democracy and a market economy.
